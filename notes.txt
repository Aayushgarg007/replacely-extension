article for developing this extension

# content scripts
    - They let you modify the webpage DOM, working in isolation from the original webpage JavaScript.
    - An extension on a webpage can execute multiple content scripts.
    - Each of these scripts would run in their own isolated world.
    - Each isolated world has its JavaScript environment that ensures libraries don’t conflict with each other.
    - The DOM is shared between all the content scripts and the original webpage’s JavaScript.

# background scripts
    - This script listens to specific events in the background, such as changing tabs, URL updates, and adding a bookmark, 
      and it does a variety of other things to affect how the browser as a whole behaves.
    - Unlike content scripts, it works as a whole for the browser instead of having separate instances in separate tabs.
    - Although we can have multiple background scripts for an extension.
    - Also, background scripts get executed as soon as the browser launches,
      whereas content scripts get executed when the webpage on which the script is to be executed loads.
